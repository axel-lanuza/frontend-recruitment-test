## npm script commands

`backpack-react-scripts` is listed as a `devDependency` in your [package.json][3] and exposes the following
npm scripts:

- `npm start`: Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to
  view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits. You will see the build errors in the console.
- `npm run build`: Runs the test watcher in an interactive mode. By default, runs tests related to files changes
  since the last commit.
- `npm test`: Builds the app for production to the build folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode
  and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
  Your app is ready to be deployed!
- `npm run lint`: Lints all javascript using [`eslint-config-skyscanner`][4].
